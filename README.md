# The DeCal Program @ SLUgS

The Society of Linguistics Undergraduate Students (SLUgS) is UC Berkeley's official student organization for undergraduate students interested in the field of Linguistics.

As part of the club, we regularly offer DeCals, which are student-run courses on topics that are not covered by Berkeley's undergraduate course catalog.

Offerings of our DeCals include:
<ul>
<li><a href="/fa23">Fall 2023</a>: Introduction to Conlanging</li>
<li><a href="/sp23">Spring 2023</a>: Introduction to Computation for Linguists</li>
</ul>

Our DeCals have previously been taught by: Pranav Jayachand, Zaid Maayah, Andres Sanchez, Naomi Schroeter, Ryan Zhu.
